R code and Latex scripts for a chapter from my PhD thesis entitled "Public Preferences and Valuation of New Malaria Risk"

This repository is intended for anyone with an interest in the research to run the code for themselves and replicate results. If you think 
improvements are possible, do let me know by opening up an issue.

The data is from a survey I conducted in Mumbai, India between April and June of 2016 during my PhD. To find out more about the 
data colleaction procedure, I refer you to the third chapter of my PhD thesis. PDF version is available via this link:
